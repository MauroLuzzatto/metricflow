## MetricFlow 0.205.0 - February 29, 2024

### Breaking Changes

- Remove SQL-Comment-Based Tags ([#1034](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1034))

### Features

- Enable querying metric_time without metrics. ([#928](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/928))
- Enable querying cumulative metrics with their agg_time_dimension. ([#1000](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1000))
- Enable offset metrics to be queried with agg_time_dimension. ([#1006](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1006))
- Add Support for Consistent SQL Query Generation ([#1020](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1020))

### Fixes

- Validate that there are metrics or group by items in each query. ([#1002](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1002))
- For measures that join to time spine, allow joining when agg_time_dimension is queried. ([#1009](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1009))
- Join to time spine if requested for conversion metric input measures. ([#1048](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1048))
- Enable querying offset metric with multiple agg_time_dimensions at once. Also fixes a bug when filtering by a different grain than the group by grain. ([#1052](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1052), [#1053](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1053))
- Bug fix: if measure joins to time spine, apply filters again after that join. ([#1039](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1039))
- Improve error message for metrics/queries with missing inputs ([#1051](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1051))

### Docs

- change group-bys to group-by in the tutorial message

### Under the Hood

- Add test for nested derived metric filter rendering bug fixed in 0.204.0 ([#920](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/920))

### Dependencies

- Remove unused numpy dependency ([#984](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/984))
- Update Jinja2 past 3.1.3 to resolve CVE-2024-22195 ([#1049](https://github.com/dbt-labs/metricflow/issues/1049))
